# Inliner user study




A few notes on the parameters of the experiment.

1. You are free to use any resources to solve the problem, including Google and StackOverflow. You may also read and modify the Seaborn library itself -- a copy has been provided in `inliner-experiments/deps/seaborn`, and any edits will automatically propagate into the. <br /> <br />

2. The tasks have been specifically designed to not be solvable just through the normal documentation. Again, you may need to edit the library source code.<br /> <br />

5. The answers to the tasks are NOT cumulative. You should start from the original code snippet each time.<br /> <br />

4. Record your screen during the experiment. On Mac, press Command-Shift-5 and click the "Record Entire Screen" button, then press "Record". On Windows, press Window-G to open the Game Bar and Window-Alt-R to start recording.
